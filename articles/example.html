      <p>To include a card image in your article use the following syntax: [[Soulherder]]. Articles should not include more than about 6 - 10 card images so use them wisely.</p>

      <h3>Article Length</h3>

      <p>Articles should keep to a max word count of about 1,500.</p>

      <h3>Links</h3>

      <p>If you want to make some text into a link use the following syntax directly in your article:</p>

      <p class="indent">&lta href="<span style="color: blue;">URL to destination</span>" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">text that you click</span>&lt/a></p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <h3>Linking a Card</h3>

      <p>If you link to a card image only use Scryfalls card image URLs.</p>

      <p class="indent">&lta href="<span style="color: blue;">https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/0/50bc0f5b-7421-45b9-af85-86dd9821b7d8.jpg?1631235570</span>" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Soulherder</span>&lt/a></p>
