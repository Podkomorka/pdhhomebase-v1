      <p>Effective September 1, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plist/109/oubliette" target="_blank">Oubliette</a> will no longer be legal in Pauper Duel Commander. (This does not affect multiplayer PDH.)</p>

      <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/9/6/96ccfecd-0dab-426a-8897-86c73934d21d.jpg?1599764501" alt="Oubliette" class="card">

      <p>Have you ever watched a bully and had to grit your teeth, hoping they get a taste of their own medicine? Well, Oubliette, this is how it feels!</p>

      <p>Over the past month the PDC RC have met to review the state of the format. Following the forming of the Pauper Duel Commander Rules Committee earlier this year, there has been a lot of discussion, and overall we are happy with where the format is heading.</p>

      <h2>So Why Ban Oubliette?</h2>

      <p>Oubliette is a relic of MTG's first-ever expansion, coming in long before they worked it all out. Its wording has been problematic since day one *, its abilities sit outside the modern "<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2021-10-18" target="_blank">Color Pie</a>", and some have said its unique ability flies in the face of the 'Spirit of Commander'.</p>

      <p>As an RC, our priority for the format is growth. So if a card threatens that growth, or if it's creating feel-bads, it goes on the watch-list. Of course these are subjective reasons, but they're not the only ones:</p>

      <div class="indent">
        <ol>
          <li>Oubliette is the only card which can completely lock a commander out of the Command Zone. It was not designed with this in mind, and is uniquely powerful as a result.</li>
          <li>Unlike similar effects (<a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/1/51765d87-e842-4d84-aaf0-998737fe754c.jpg?1562735580" target="_blank">Deep Freeze</a>, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/b/1/b1349c3d-39ad-40ba-897e-59e5b76de853.jpg?1562201189" target="_blank">Reprobation</a> etc) Oubliette cannot be removed through Combat, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/0/a03c738c-88d9-4cf6-a650-20ce6e5565bc.jpg?1637630249" target="_blank">sacrifice</a>, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/4/9/49ee9af3-d61c-4964-88a6-6e8ad6a6a29a.jpg?1562910438" target="_blank">bounce</a>, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/4/d45b0ed8-8692-4fa7-b32c-30d29028da3d.jpg?1562939913" target="_blank">protection</a>, or even a players own kill-spells.</li>
          <li>It has the power to single-handedly shut down Commander-centric strategies. We believe this is bad for the health and diversity of the format.</li>
          <li>The last Oracle update (2020) not only changed the way Oubliette interacts with commanders, but it was upshifted to uncommon. The card - as worded now - has never existed at common. *</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>What Else Did You Talk About?</h2>

      <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/6/b/6b921a42-8da9-454e-9791-cc3f4da34023.jpg?1632145801" alt="Loyal Apprentice" class="card">

      <p>The August Review covered a lot of topics: Partner Commanders, Lieutenants, Monarchy, Initiative, Loyal Apprentice, Baleful Strix, and even sideboards. Without going into it too much, the general stance was that while all of these can be powerful, the data doesn't justify a change at this time.</p>

      <p>The greatest example of this is Loyal Apprentice, who is seeing a lot of play and boasts a 62% win-rate in recent tournaments. However, this is not the highest! Loyal places 4th when compared to other decks (with 20+ recorded games). The real bogeymen, statistically, are <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/e/de0ba512-b6c3-4931-be05-cb6bd03a4b7c.jpg?1644853028" target="_blank">Keleth</a> or <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/1/7/17416926-168b-49b3-9231-acbb8f8a1d13.jpg?1557577188" target="_blank">Rakdos</a>!</p>

      <p>So far we've seen a fantastic amount of deck-diversity in tournaments, and while some decks are performing very well, we don't believe any are dominating (although we continue to watch closely). There were perhaps three areas which came close to a change:</p>

      <h3>Lotus Petal</h3>

      <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/1/5/153983dd-54dc-420d-9249-665b0d669614.jpg?1573517235" alt="Lotus Petal" class="card">

      <p>...and other rituals. In the current meta here at Home Base, aggro and burn decks have been performing extremely well, to the point where we've been considering ways to reign them in (without killing them completely). These are decks like <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/c/5cd87cf8-4d5d-4aba-8dfa-800b1fb3799b.jpg?1608910155" target="_blank">Dargo</a>/<a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/8/6/86958821-76eb-43a5-974b-7c945e826a66.jpg?1611933914" target="_blank">Esior</a>, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/a/4/a4fab67f-00c2-4125-9262-d21a29411797.jpg?1644853041" target="_blank">Rograkh</a>/<a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/d/e/de0ba512-b6c3-4931-be05-cb6bd03a4b7c.jpg?1644853028" target="_blank">Keleth</a>, and of course Loyal Apprentice.</p>

      <p>Some of the most unbeatable hands for these decks involve an early Lotus Petal, <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/e/0e57335d-4066-4d73-83cd-67a215e01a4e.jpg?1619397622" target="_blank">Simian Spirit Guide</a> or <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/c/0/c062caf7-f0eb-44db-9f74-e6711a13fada.jpg?1593275318" target="_blank">Rite of Flame</a>, either because they allow a commander on turn 1, or because they allow a surprise re-cast on turn 3. On the other hand. If drawn late, or while top-decking, a Lotus Petal can be worse than a basic land. So we didn't ban them - it may be that players still need time to adjust to the lower life-totals. Until we have more data, we can only wait and see.</p>

      <h3>Commons in the Command Zone</h3>

      <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/6/f/6f706ac3-0ad8-44ac-a99e-21c04075951d.jpg?1660723544" alt="Candlekeep Sage" class="card">

      <p>A surprisingly contentious subject. Everyone on the RC wants to open up deckbuilding options - but only where safe to do so. We must acknowledge our close-ties with multiplayer PDH. A change to PDC rules here would clash with their decision to not allow common backgrounds. As such there were some concerns this could create a rift, which could hurt the growth of the format. Overall while we believe the risks to the format are minimal, so too are the gains. We will continue to monitor things as they change.</p>

      <h3>Planeswalker Commanders</h3>

      <img src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/5/a/5a10b543-d5d4-42a8-9ee8-dada59a2ad7e.jpg?1557577385" alt="Saheeli, Sublime Artificer" class="card">

      <p>Similar to the commons debate, planeswalker commanders discussion boiled down to either opening up new and fun deck building options or wanting to stay as close as possible to the PDH ruleset. While more members were in favour of walkers than commons, the subject was raised too late in the review period. So watch closely (we'll review it again early next year!)</p>

      <p>And that about does it! What do you think? Did we make the right decisions? Did we miss anything? Don't be afraid of upsetting us. Hit us up on Discord. Don't forget to sign up to the next tournament, there's always something going on!</p>

      <p><strong>* Oubliette Oracle Text changes, in Chronological order:</strong></p>

      <p>Since its creation the wording on Oubliette has gone through every conceivable iteration! First, it worked like a complicated <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/0/8/0858ab5a-930c-44f0-9621-4dd634cf39c6.jpg?1631233896" target="_blank">Banishing Light</a>, which tracked auras and counters. Then they tried to simplify it by using phasing, and made it two triggers so it would work like <a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/4/6/4686b51c-e02b-48c1-bafe-e8d08a5407b9.jpg?1592712799" target="_blank">Journey to Nowhere</a>. But then, they removed the phasing (so it ignored equipment - but they kept the two triggers). Finally, they switched it back to phasing, and removed the second triggered ability! See for yourself -</p>

      <p><a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/3/0/30d1450f-2909-410e-9920-731278fa74de.jpg?1562904037" target="_blank">1993</a> - Arabian Nights - “Select a creature in play when Oubliette is cast. That creature is considered out of play as long as Oubliette is in play. Hence the creature cannot be the target of spells and cannot receive damage, use special powers, attack, or defend. All counters and enchantments on the creature remain but are also out of play. If Oubliette is removed, creature returns to play tapped.</p>

      <p>1996 - Mirage - “When Oubliette comes into play, target creature phases out. That creature can't phase in as long as Oubliette remains in play. When Oubliette leaves play, the creature phases in tapped." - <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/old-cards-new-words-2002-08-09" target="_blank">Article here.</a></p>

Note the number and kind of counters that were on that creature. When Oubliette leaves play, return the removed card to play under its owner's control tapped with the noted number and kind of counters on it. If you do, return the removed Aura cards to play under their owner's control attached to that permanent." - <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/masters-edition-update-bulletin-2007-08-29" target="_blank">Article here</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/d/4/d4800a7d-c229-4ced-97ff-0e58645d58d6.jpg?1599705817" target="_blank">2020</a> - Double Masters - “When Oubliette enters the battlefield, target creature phases out until Oubliette leaves the battlefield. Tap that creature as it phases in this way. (Auras and Equipment phase out with it. While permanents are phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist.)"</p>
